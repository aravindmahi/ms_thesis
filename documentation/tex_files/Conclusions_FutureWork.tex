In this work we built a novel query expansion methodology using Probabilistic Soft Logic.
We showed how such a vocabulary has a direct impact on the recall of documents and the accuracy of prediction algorithms.
%Specifically we were on an average able to reduce the MAPE error of election prediction algorithms by 15.58\%.
It is important to note that though we used elections to show performance gains, the query expansion system is generic and can be used to learn a vocabulary for any given domain.
Further, this work is motivated towards a future goal to model the electorate demographics.
With more fine grained data about the gender, age and exact location of a user it is possible to infer the preferences at a group level rather than at a user level.
This would enable us to study the various interactions between groups and individual users in more detail and thus make more informed election predictions.
